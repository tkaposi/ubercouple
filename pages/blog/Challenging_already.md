Wow, the first night was not a smooth ride at all! Everything went pretty fine until right after the 
second nap at 01:30 (again, Marlene couldn't sleep) when all of a sudden, Tobi experienced 
zombie-level tiredness. The scheduled activity (sorting of paper documents) proved to be too 
complicated and at the same time didn't provide enough movement, so Tobi switched to emptying and 
cleaning a book shelf. Later we tried going for a walk, taking a shower, playing a [clapping game](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapping_game) (quite recommended), preparing and eating a snack, and 
doing some light exercise, all of which was barely enough to keep him awake. Marlene on the other 
hand was fine, which helped immensely. Her only sleep dep symptom was a tingling skin sensation (like 
very small needle pricks).

The 05:30 nap was a tiny bit refreshing; Marlene slept for maybe 10 minutes. Still, motivation was at 
a minimum for the first hour afterwards as we were both feeling a little nausea (probably just from 
being hungry) and vertigo. We haven't really figured out when and how much to eat yet, and Marlene 
seems to be always thirsty although we rehydrate at a minimum rate of about 125 mL/h. After breakfast 
daylight quickly reduced Tobi's tiredness (a little ranting and swearing about the situation might 
have helped, too), whereas now Marlene seems to be getting more and more tired.

Now we are past the 09:30 nap (Tobi had dreams) and feeling... let's say ok.
