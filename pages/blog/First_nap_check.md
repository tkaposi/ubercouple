Well, this is it! We have officially completed the first nap out of 42 for this week!
Our last "real" sleep last night was not overwhelmingly long and/or refreshing for both
of us, so we were already quite tired before napping at 21:30. Still, Marlene didn't sleep 
at all and Tobi had trouble falling asleep, but was then extremely startled by the alarm.
Now, after a small evening snack and a little final organizational stuff we are both fine
and not really tired. Still looking forward to that next nap in (only!) 2.5 hours.
