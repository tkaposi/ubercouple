As we mentioned doing organizational stuff in the last post here's a little something about that.
The brunt of our preparatory work has certainly gone into all sorts of lists, cheat sheets, and 
schedules. This has has been mainly due to [Puredoxyk's](http://www.puredoxyk.com/) book
*Ubersleep* and the good advice she gives therein, with a few modifications by ourselves. We have
made a **big fat list** of things to do during adaptation and have filled a schedule for the 
week with them and some daily regulars. It looks like a monster in orange and blue, see approx. 
half of it (in German) below.

Moreover, there's a list for emergency situations in case we need to urgently do something to 
avoid falling asleep, but can't come up with anything because "braaaaaiiiiins", and a list of 
buffer activities in case some of the scheduled activities don't take as long as planned. All in 
all, we have somewhere around 70-80 different activities, some of which are going to take a long 
while (like tidying up our cellar for the first time since moving in). Finally, there's a list 
of stuff to cook during the week which we also used to fill a corresponding schedule. This will
hopefully avoid unnecessary and tedious thinking about what to cook before trips to the supermarket.
