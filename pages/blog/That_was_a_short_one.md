Hello, World, again!

We are very sad to announce a stop of our experiment. We did not botch a nap or feel so tired we 
couldn't go on, but had to pull the plug out of medical issues only indirectly related to the 
sleeping cycle. As most of you will already know, Marlene badly hurt her right ankle last December 
and suffered from severe bone bruise. It took a few months for her to be able to walk normally again, 
but her foot still swells and hurts after hiking or other strenuous activity. As it turns out, 
polyphasic sleeping is one such activity. Being up and running for 22 hours a day made her ankle 
complain within less than a day and already yesterday evening she had to resort to sitting 
activities. Applying cool packs and massages didn't improve the situation. 

So that's why we decided, after almost 45 minutes of wide-awake discussion in the middle of the 
night, to stop the experiment for now and try another time when Marlene's ankle will have healed to 
the point where strenuous activities become possible again. We are of course a bit upset by this turn 
of events, but our health is the clear priority here. We had a lot of both fun and ugliness within 
"just" one day of ubersleeping and will definitely try to do it again. Regarding our loyal blog 
followers we apologize profusely for letting you down so early. To you it was just one day of 
following us, although it felt more like three to us, and we greatly enjoyed reading your comments. We 
hope you folks can understand and also hope you'll all be there when we try next time.

So long and thanks for all the fish.
