Things got better and better during the day again, although this is most probably just a jet-lag-like 
effect. Our bodies are simply used to being awake during those hours and complain less about the 
sleep deprivation (sleep dep). Anyway, we won't complain. Both morning and afternoon were ok and we 
got a lot of stuff done, although we used the afternoon in a more relaxing fashion than initially 
planned. Didn't hurt a bit.

We were home in time for the 17:30 nap, feeling quite fine and going to sleep a little tired. 
However, about half a minute before the alarm Tobi woke up, completely startled, and dead sure that 
we had overslept for hours. To him the nap had felt like a few hours of sleep, although just the 
usual 20 minutes had passed. We had heard about this time dilation effect, but didn't expect it so 
soon. It didn't happen with the 21:30 nap, though. In general our time perception is somehow 
changing. The hours between naps seem to almost fly by, but the whole afternoon felt more like 
Tuesday than Monday, although this doesn't really describe it completely.

Now we are back to night time activities with not too much tiredness on either side, yet.
