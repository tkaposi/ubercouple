Hello, World!

This is a blog about two crazy people trying to reduce their daily time spent sleeping to about 2 hours by adapting to a sleep schedule fittingly called "uberman", hence the blog's name. Here, we will collect bits and pieces of information about why we are doing this, how we are preparing, and how we are faring through an adaptation phase others have described as "[utterly zombifying](http://www.puredoxyk.com/index.php/2006/12/11/does-adapting-to-polyphasic-sleep-hurt-your-performance/)".

Have fun exploring this site and reading about our ugly experiences. Head over to the [About](./about) section to find more general information on polyphasic sleeping and a few good links. It seems the polyphasic community has been steadily growing over the last couple of years now and we hope to make a valuable contribution by providing information others might find useful when preparing for or going through adaptation.

Adaptation will start on Sunday, August 9th.

Best,

Marlene & Tobi
