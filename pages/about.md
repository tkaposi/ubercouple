This is the story of Marlene and Tobi trying to adapt to the uberman polyphasic sleep schedule. We are a young couple of scientists (Marlene is a chemist, Tobi a physicist) embarking on a crazy "self-experiment" in order to see whether two hours of sleep a day are really enough for the human body (and mind, for that matter) or not. We've been thinking about doing this for a long time and have finally set our minds to tackling a new and (probably quite) challenging endeavour.

## Polyphasic sleeping

During our preparation time we have been talking about polyphasic sleeping to a lot of people and hardly anyone seems to have come across the subject. So, here's a little information about it.

"Normal" human beings usually sleep between 7-9 hours every night, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. Sometimes we go to bed early, other times circumstances dictate... otherwise. All in all, we pretty much "loose" one third of our day to one big chunk of regeneration which is still being heavily investigated by neuroscientists today "despite" being such an integral part of our lifes. Let's call this sleeping schedule monophasic. Polyphasic sleeping on the other hand is an umbrella term for a variety of schedules that cut back on said big chunk, but at the same time add a number of power naps during the day at fixed intervals to make up for the loss at night. Apparently and for a (to the best of our knowledge) completely unknown reason, this works just as well. 

After a brief, but hard adaptation phase featuring severe sleep deprivation symptoms the human brain starts to make use of said naps and squeezes one whole sleep cycle into a 20 minute time slot, including dreams and a REM phase. A number of people have been trying or doing this over the last few years and apparently it works for an (as yet) undefined period of time without (as yet) discernible ramifications regarding health and/or mental well-being. Some big names like Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla or even Albert Einstein come up now and again as possible practicioners of polyphasic sleeping, but there is very little historic evidence to support these claims. However, American architect [Richard Buckminster Fuller][1] lived on a polyphasic schedule for two years during the 1920s and over the last two decades several more people have started showing interest in "polyphasing" and doing it over extended periods of time.

Still, scientific evidence on the subject is scarce at best, as can be seen from the graph showing the amount of papers published on "polyphasic + sleep" since 1995. Many of these papers are actually studies on hormone chemistry in mice which naturally exhibit polyphasic sleeping which in turn is being mentioned in the paper without being the topic. The actual amount of scientific work (and evidence) on polyphasic sleep is thus even lower. This means that, sadly, right now the Internet is still the best place to find information on polyphasing, adaptation, drawbacks, and "field reports" in general. Here's a collection of some sources the interested reader might find useful:

* [Good old Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep)
* [puredoxyk's blog](http://www.puredoxyk.com/) - she's been doing this for years now, on many different schedules

* [Steve Pavlina's blog](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/) - he did it for a few months
* [Field report](http://qz.com/430415/i-once-tried-to-cheat-sleep-and-for-a-year-i-succeeded/)  of a chemistry PhD student showing a nice diagram depicting different schedules. Marlene and Tobi will try to adapt to "uberman"
* [A short piece](http://qz.com/424120/our-poor-sleeping-habits-could-be-filling-our-brains-with-neurotoxins/) featuring a 2013 science paper which states that long periods of sleep are necessary for the brain to flush out accumulated neurotoxins
