This is the story of Marlene and Tobi trying to adapt to the uberman polyphasic sleep schedule. We are a young couple of scientists (Marlene is a chemist, Tobi a physicist) embarking on a crazy "self-experiment" in order to see whether two hours of sleep a day are really enough for the human body (and mind, for that matter) or not. We've been thinking about doing this for a long time and have finally set our minds to tackling a new and (probably quite) challenging endeavour.

## Polyphasic sleeping

More information on polyphasic sleeping will be added soon.

## This site

This website is a blatant copy of [obda.net](https://obda.net) regarding both layout as well as software being used. Head over there for more information about its structure and programming. You can find the entire [source code for this site on GitHub](https://github.com/tkaposi/ubercouple/tree/master) and can easily make your own website with very little python/CSS knowledge by downloading the repo from there and adapting the content to your needs.

Many thanks go to Tobi's brother Clemens for maintaining the domain, hosting the site there, many hours of calmly reiterating instructions, hints, and comp. sci. basics, and for suggesting this type of website in the first place.
